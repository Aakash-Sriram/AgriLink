## Best Practices

### Development
1. Never store sensitive data in code
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Validate all inputs
5. Use HTTPS for all API calls
6. Regular dependency updates
7. Code signing and verification

### Deployment
1. Regular security audits
2. Automated dependency updates
3. SSL/TLS configuration
4. Firewall setup
5. Regular backups
6. Infrastructure as Code
7. Secrets management

## Security Checks

Run security audit:
```bash
# Backend
pip-audit
bandit -r .

# Frontend
npm audit
yarn audit
```

Check for vulnerabilities:
```bash
# Backend
safety check

# Frontend
npm audit fix
snyk test
```

## Incident Response

1. Identify and classify the issue
2. Contain the breach
3. Eradicate the cause
4. Recover systems
5. Document lessons learned
6. Update security measures
7. Notify affected parties

## Security Monitoring

1. Real-time threat detection
2. Automated vulnerability scanning
3. Access log monitoring
4. Rate limit monitoring
5. Error rate tracking
6. Transaction monitoring
